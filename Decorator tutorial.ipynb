It returns `wrapper` function in the end. So one of the attributes of the decorator is to intake a function (object) and output a function (object).\n",

Inside the `wrapper`, line 5 is to call the function being decorated; and line 8 is to return the output from the function being decorated. Besides line 5 & 8, i.e. line 4, 6, 7 are the extention of the function being decorated. In this example, the extended functionality is to show how much time the function being decorated takes. \n",

If not using syntactic sugar like in `Part B`, to perform the same as `Part D`, line 31-32 is the equivalent way.\n",

At this moment, `subtract` is equal to `wrapper`. When it pass parameter `2` & `4`, it starts running the line 4-8, including line 5 the actual `def subtract(a, b)`.
